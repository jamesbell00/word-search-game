# Word Search Game

[Project Details](https://jamesbell34.wixsite.com/website/blank-page) ( includes report and video presentation )


## Details

This project was designed and implemented by myself and a colleague from class for our Object Oriented Design class. Our task was to create a word search game with a timer and a scoreboard. The timer would start as soon as the game does, and if the player finds the word before the timer runs out, they advance to the next level, or else they lose. The score is dependent on how long the player took to find the hidden word. Our implementation will include increasing levels of difficulty, high scores, conditionally playing sounds and different word categories.
